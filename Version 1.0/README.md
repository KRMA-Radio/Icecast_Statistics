# krma_analytics

The goal of this script is to parse a log file into the necessary components to correlate a log entry with a radio show time slot.

Once a console based application is built, I plan to move the data into a database for longterm storage. 
I will build web views for administrative access and data views for users.

<b>Running this script using:</b><br> 
    $ tail -n 10 access.log | python server.py
